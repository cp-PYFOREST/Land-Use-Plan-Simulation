# Land-Use-Plan-Simulation

Scripts to create mock properties and simulates land use plans(LUP) based on forestry regulations.

Estimate the amount of area designated as forest reserve based on current and alternate laws for undeveloped regions;

## Description

The Gran Chaco is a 271.8 million acre ecoregion extending across Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. The Gran Chaco contains South America's second largest forest and is one of the continent's last frontiers. However, the forest is threatened by agricultural and economic development, primarily for beef and soy production, leading to extensive deforestation and environmental degradation.

Our project focuses on the Paraguayan Chaco, a region where deforestation driven by cattle ranching and cropping has resulted in the loss of approximately 1.6 million acres of forest between 2017 and 2020. Paraguay has a variety of laws in place to conserve forest cover in this region. To develop land in the Paraguayan Chaco, cattle ranchers must submit land use plans (LUPs) that comply with forestry laws enforced by Paraguay's National Forestry Institute (INFONA). These plans must include a forest reserve covering 25% of the designated land, a 100-meter hedgerow buffer, a 100-meter riparian forest, and paddocks of less than 100 hectares where deforestation is authorized. With tensions rising between the need for economic development and forest conservation, policymakers are currently considering modifications to these laws in response to various stakeholders' needs. Potential modifications to these laws could lead to an increase or decrease in the required forest reserves.

However, policymakers are currently facing challenges in understanding how much forest will be conserved under the existing laws and the potential impact of modifying these laws. To address this issue, our project aims to estimate how changes to the rules governing private LUPs would affect the extent of forest cover and agricultural land in the Paraguayan Chaco.

This repository houses scripts to create mock properties and simulates land use plans(LUP) based on forestry regulations and estimates the amount of area designated as forest reserve based on current and alternate laws for undeveloped region of the Paraguayan Chaco. \## Getting Started
